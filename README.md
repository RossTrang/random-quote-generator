# FreeCodeCamp Intermediate Frontend Project - Random Quote Generator Challenge
## https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine

### User Stories:
    1) Clicking a button will load a new random quote
    2) Click a button to share the quote via Twitter (_optional_)

I've set myself the goal of using no frameworks. CSS Grid will be used in place of
Bootstrap and the native JavaScript Web API will carry out the JQuery/Ajax functions.

The only freely public quote API I could find (that didn't have CORS issues) was
for Ron Swanson quotes, so I've built a Ron-dom Quote Generator. FML!
